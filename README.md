### RepoFinder is here to bring you a seamless way to add all of your favorite repositories right into the package manager of your choice.

With  **RepoFinder**  you can...

-   Discover new repos that you may have never seen before
-   Find any of your favorite repos
-   Browse through our extensive library of repos and add any of them straight into the package manager of your choice
-   Journey the app to your heart's content in a beautiful dark mode (if that's what you enjoy doing with your time :P)

My goal behind this app was to make the experience for the user as easy as possible and as simple as possible. Therefore, the app has only two pages. One is a list of repos and the other is a settings page with my twitter link.

If RepoFinder does not show up on your home screen, try clearing UICache.  
*(RepoFinder is not a package manager but instead is a repository library.)*
