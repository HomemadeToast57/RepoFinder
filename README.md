Find Your Repos!

RepoFinder is an app here to bring you a seamless way to add all of your favorite repositories right into the package manager of your choice.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

With RepoFinder you can...

Discover new repos that you may have never seen before
Find any of your favorite repos
Browse through our extensive library of repos and add any of them straight into the package manager of your choice
Journey the app to your heart's content in a beautiful dark mode (if that's what you enjoy doing with your time :P)


My goal behind this app was to make the experience for the user as easy as possible and as simple as possible. Therefore, the app has only two pages. One is a list of repos and the other is a settings page with my twitter link.

If RepoFinder does not show up on your home screen, try clearing UICache.

*(RepoFinder is not a package manager but instead is a repository library.)*
